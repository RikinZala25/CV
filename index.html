  <p>Hello there!
    <br>
    I am a Computer Science and Engineering student at Indus University. I enjoy writing code. Since I started writing my first program in the C language in 10th grade, I've loved making typos and errors, and solving them was the best thing.
    <br>
    I enjoy delving into problems and solving them precisely, referring to quick adaptive insights.
    <br>
    I'm interested in learning more about other sites and coding techniques and how to be more efficient with them.
    <br>
    StackOverflow is my go-to site for troubleshooting errors and assisting others with their problems if I'm up to it. I enjoy working in groups and am willing to assist one another with projects.
    <br>
    Domains: IT-related.
    <br>
    I'm always willing to learn new things that will help me progress even further.
    <br>
    But there is still much work to be done for a better future.
    <br>
